## DESCRIPTION

This is a CLI README file creator. It utilizes the CLI to collect user inputs and uses them to create a README file with a pre=written template. Upon running, it will ask for the name of the application, the programmer's name, the use of the application, the programmer's GitHub name, and their e-mail.

## CREDITS

This program was written by me, Kyle Oros, based off a template provided by my UCI Bootcamp. I received assistance from AskBCS in writing it.
